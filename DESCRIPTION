Description: Scaffold an entire web-based report using template chunks, based on a small chapter overview and a dataset. 
    Highly adaptable with prefixes, suffixes, translations, etc. Also contains tools for password-protecting,
    e.g. for each organization's report on a website. Developed for the common case of a survey across multiple organizations/sites
    where each organization wants to obtain results for their organization compared with everyone else.
    See 'saros' (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=saros>) for tools used for authors in the drafted reports.
