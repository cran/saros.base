Quarto stops in the middle of rendering and complains that it cannot find a shape or another file.
: This is most likely caused by running Render while in a folder that has too long a path, on a Sharepoint/Teams folder. Move everything together to e.g. `%HOMEPATH%/AppData/Saros/Project/` and try again.

Quarto can't find R?
: You have R installed in an AppData folder path. Uninstall R, make yourself an administrator, open the R installation file as an administrator and install instead in Program files or Program Files.

Sudden strange error
: Try rendering again, might solve itself.
